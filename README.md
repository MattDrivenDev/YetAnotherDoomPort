# Yet Another Doom Port
This time in Monogame working from a YouTube video series found here: [Recreating DOOM in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdYTvqZmyBk&list=PLi77irUVkDasNAYQPr3N8nVcJLQAlANva).

Built using Dotnet 7, Monogame 3.8, the shareware doom1.wad file and VS Code.

## More Theory / Documentation
I found [DIY Doom](https://github.com/amroibrahim/DIYDoom) which seems to very carefully go through the theory of how the engine works which is really nice with diagrams etc. Worth looking at too.
